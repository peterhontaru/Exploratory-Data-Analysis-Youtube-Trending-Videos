YouTube Trending Videos
================

# 1\. Background

### Why this dataset?

YouTube has been an influential source of knowledge both in my
professional life as well in my personal goals/ambitions. Thus, I
thought it would be interesting to **explore** this dataset, gather
**insights** and understand the more about the platform.

### What are Trending Videos and why are they important?

Trending videos work alongside the home page to provide users with
content to watch. While the home page is **highly personalised** (via
the YouTube algorithm) on previous views, what the user watched longest,
engagement, subscriptions, the trending page is **very broad and
identical across all accounts**. Since it shows this feed to hundreds of
thousands of accounts, it serves as a great source of views for content
creators (think viral videos).

### Purpose of this analysis:

1.  **Develop an understanding of the YouTube Trending Videos**
2.  **Assess differences between English-speaking countries (Canada,
    Great Britain, United States of America)**

*Thus, all throughout, we will generate questions, answer them with data
and then further refine these questions based on what was discovered.*
